2002 Hall of Fame Inductee Jim Jenkins â€“ Westminster
Jim Jenkins was born and raised in Westminster, Colorado. He graduated from Westminster
High School in 1959. He went on to Colorado State University. After he graduated from CSU,
Jim began his teaching and coaching career at Ranum High School. He coached baseball at
Ranum from 1968 to 1982. He enjoyed unprecedented success at Ranum. His overall won-
loss record during his nineteen-year coaching career was 255-76-2. He won one state
championship, finished second once and third once. His teams won ten Skyline League
championships. He was selected as Skyline Coach of the Year four times. He was also
selected as the District and State Coach of the Year once.
Many of Jim's players went on to play college baseball and several played professionally. Jim
was always honest and fair to his players. He very rarely yelled at umpires and never at his
kids. He was a student of the game and always was willing to incorporate new coaching
strategies during preparation for the season. One example was the use of the double
squeeze, which he used successfully several times. In one playoff game against a team with
great talent, he had his players bunt six times in a row because his scouting report said this
team did not play the bunt well. Ranum scored four runs and went on to win the game and
advance to the final four.
Jim was a credit to high school baseball and is most deserving of induction into the CHSBUA
