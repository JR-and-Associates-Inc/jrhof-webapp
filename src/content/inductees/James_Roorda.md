Hall of Fame Inductee James “Jim” Roorda – Denver
James “Jim” Roorda graduated in 1959 from Denver South High School where he was very involved
athletically and named to the All-State baseball team as a catcher. Jim furthered his education by
earning a B.A. degree from U.N.C. and then a master’s degree from C.S.U.
Jim’s career was focused on vocational education, teaching distributive education in both Las Animas
and Loveland. He went on to become an associate director of vocational education at Aims Community
College in its formative years. This led to him becoming a member of the state board for vocational
education in Denver. He finished his career with the St. Vrain Valley School District.
Jim was a very active dad who was always there for his boys and their activities, as a coach, cheerleader
or spectator. Jim was one of the five men along with some key city council members that were
instrumental in planning and building Centennial Baseball fields. He was very proud of this achievement,
knowing that thousands of young people have benefited from using this facility.
