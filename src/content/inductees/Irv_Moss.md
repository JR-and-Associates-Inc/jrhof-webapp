1990 Hall of Fame Inductee Irv Moss â€“ Denver
Irv Moss, who has a sports writer at the Denver Post for nearly half a century, he won't divulge when he
started there, has seen virtually every side of sports from youth baseball to high school to college and
the pros.
A Denver West graduate, Irv went on to continue his education at Colorado A&M (now Colorado State
University in Fort Collins) and the University of Denver. He went on to serve in the United States Army
where his writing career actually began at a public information office in Germany.
Irv returned to Denver and starting working at night at the Denver Post in the editorial area. That's
where he befriended sports editor Chuck Garrity, who offered Moss a position in the sports department.
He's been an institution ever since.
Irv started covering high school sports and graduated to coverage of the University of Wyoming and the
United States Air Force Academy. He was a general assignment reporter for Colorado State University
and also dabbled with coverage of the University of Colorado. He's also covered the Nuggets, Broncos
and Rockies during his career.
He was instrumental in starting up the Denver vs. Suburban all-star baseball game originally held at
Bears Stadium. The event was sponsored by the Denver Post.
Irv points to Eric Young's leadoff home run in the bottom of the first inning in the Colorado Rockies'
inaugural home game at Mile High Stadium as "one of the most electrifying sports days I've ever been
around." Irv speaks so fondly of players who have crossed his path with special mention of Goose
Gossage, Fred Steinmark and Don Sessions!
