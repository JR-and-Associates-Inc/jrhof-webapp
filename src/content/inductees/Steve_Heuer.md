**Steve Heuer’s name is synonymous with commitment, endurance, and excellence in Colorado high school officiating.** After arriving in Denver in 1967, Steve embarked on a legendary career that would span over six decades and touch nearly every sport sanctioned by the Colorado High School Activities Association (CHSAA).

Steve’s officiating career began even earlier, at age 16, umpiring little league games. By 1962, while attending the University of Illinois on a football and track scholarship, he registered with the National Federation and began officiating intramurals—an effort to help pay for school while also honing his skills. His dedication to officiating only grew from there.

Upon moving to Colorado, Steve joined the Aurora Sports Officials under the guidance of Dave and Mert Letofsky and was later welcomed into the Jefferson County Baseball Umpires’ Association. There, he worked alongside future CHSBUA Hall of Fame legends like Julius Carabello, Lou Nolin, Bud Schoepflin, and Joe Rossi. Despite limited on-field training in those days, Steve’s natural leadership and dedication quickly earned him championship-level assignments.

**Over the years, Steve would become known for his precision, professionalism, and unwavering commitment to the game.** He has officiated multiple district, regional, and state finals—most notably a state championship baseball game in 2023 at the age of 79, where he served as the plate umpire. His remarkable estimate: over 10,000 baseball games officiated, and nearly 30,000 total across all sports.

Outside of officiating, Steve’s career as a **chemical engineer** took him to Amoco Oil, where he led hazardous waste recovery projects and earned patents for innovative oil treatment technologies. During his assignment at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, he received a direct commission to captain and oversaw critical operations.

Today, Steve remains the senior member of CHSBUA and continues to umpire both baseball and softball. His encyclopedic knowledge of the rules has made him a respected authority—often the go-to person for resolving rule disputes both on and off the field.

> ***“It’s easier to just ask Steve than to search the rule book. He’s always right, and no one has ever disagreed with him. He’s the final word.”***
