2002 Hall of Fame Inductee Ronald Piotraschke â€“ Colorado Springs
Ronald Piotraschke graduated from Colorado University in 1954 with a Bachelor of Science
Degree in Physical Education and started umpiring baseball in Jefferson County with the
Umpire's Association of Colorado under tutelage of Bill Vincent. Ron learned quickly
working midget and junior games with the one-umpire system. Fees were four dollars per
game and the usual schedule carried a double header on Saturday followed by another on
Sunday. Ron worked his way up to Legion A and B and finally to semi-pro at the Jefferson
County Fairground. Ron also worked fast pitch softball around the Denver and Englewood
area.
At Cheraw School near LaJunta, Ron was responsible for starting the baseball program and
taught there for nine years. He then moved to England for four years and on to Colorado
Springs where George Theodore and Bob Mullenberg guided his career.
While in Colorado Springs, Ron worked several Class A Tournaments and many district and
regional games including 3A to 5A championship games. His college games included the Air
force Academy and Colorado College. Ron was also responsible for getting the Metro League
to adopt the three-umpire system for its league tournament. Perhaps his greatest
contribution to Colorado Springs officiating was serving as the baseball and softball
assignor for 17 years retiring in 1994.
Ron was a successful teacher in Colorado for 29 years. He now lives in Fort Collins with his
wife, Alice. They have two children, Mike and Julie, and one grandson, Sam. He still works
high school softball.
