**William "Bill" Fanning – Grand Junction**

A legendary figure in Western Slope athletics, William “Bill” Fanning made a lasting impact as both a coach and official during his decades-long career in Colorado high school sports.

Bill arrived in Grand Junction in 1954 to play for the Grand Junction Eagles semipro baseball team. Shortly after, he was appointed as a teacher and the head baseball coach at Grand Junction High School. His coaching tenure was marked by remarkable success, culminating in **three state championships** and **six state runner-up finishes**.

From 1956 to 1995, Bill also distinguished himself as a multi-sport official, refereeing **baseball, basketball, football, and softball** across the Western Slope. His officiating career included a historic moment in 1958 when he umpired the **very first National Junior College World Series (JUCO)** in Grand Junction. He continued working JUCO games for fifteen consecutive years—longer than any of his peers from that inaugural crew.

Bill’s contributions were not limited to the field and court. Following his officiating career, he served as a well-known voice in the community as a **radio announcer for KREX** for over a decade.

His dedication to student-athletes and high school sports has been recognized through numerous accolades, including induction into the:
- **Colorado High School Athletic American Hall of Fame**
- **Colorado Coaches Sports Hall of Fame**
- **National High School Sports Hall of Fame**

In recognition of his enduring legacy, the **practice field at Grand Junction High School** proudly bears his name.
