**Few individuals have shaped the future of umpiring in Colorado and across the country like Dan Weikle.** With a career spanning nearly 50 years, **Dan Weikle** has not only worn the uniform — he has redefined what it means to lead, train, and elevate those who do.

Dan’s storied career began in 1975, but his influence truly exploded when he served as *CHSBUA* President from 2000–2003. With a visionary approach to training and development, Dan revolutionized how Colorado umpires prepare for the field. Inspired by a freezing 1980s trip to the *NCAA Umpire Development Program* in Kansas City, Dan returned home determined to build something even better in Denver — and he did just that.

Together with Keith Bailey and Ray Belfiore, Dan brought the NCAA’s elite training model to Colorado, making advanced instruction accessible right here at home. He didn’t stop there. Dan invited Jon Bible, the NCAA’s first National Umpire Coordinator, to Colorado to mentor local umpires, launching a movement of hands-on education that culminated in the creation of the *Mile High Advanced Umpire Clinic* (MHAUC). With top-tier instructors like Bob Jones, this clinic became a nationally recognized force, with over two-thirds of *CHSBUA* umpires selected for postseason assignments having gone through Dan’s training pipeline.

But Dan’s legacy goes far beyond clinics and credentials. He was a relentless advocate for opportunity and access. In the late 1980s, he approached Denver Zephyrs GM Tom Mahoney to ask for a few tickets so trainees could watch professional umpires. Instead, the Zephyrs gave every clinic participant season passes — a testament to Dan’s persuasive power and the respect he commanded. He later brought *CHSBUA* meetings to Mile High Stadium suites, merging education with inspiration in unforgettable settings.

Though he humbly downplays his on-field accomplishments, Dan’s biggest impact has always been behind the scenes — building platforms for others to rise. He created not only MHAUC, but also *CHSBUA’s Umpire Training, Evaluation, and Promotion (UTEP)* program, and eventually scaled his passion to the national level. From 2010 to 2016, Dan served as the *NCAA Division II National Umpire Coordinator*. Under his leadership, Division II saw the birth of two major training clinics — The *Palm Beach Challenge* and The *Desert Challenge* — and the establishment of the first-ever Regional Advisors, most of whom were former *CHSBUA* and *MHAUC* alums.

> Dan Weikle’s dedication, vision, and unrelenting belief in people have left a permanent mark on the game — and on the thousands of umpires who call it. His legacy is one of excellence, generosity, and a deep love for the craft of officiating. The Hall of Fame proudly welcomes a true giant of the game.
