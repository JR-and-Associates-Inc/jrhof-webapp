2000 Hall of Fame Inductee Frank Messenger â€“ Fort Collins
Frank Messenger has umpired from Tobacco Road to South Boulder Road, and in his 27 years as an
umpire he has served on more committees than a senior member of Congress. Among the more
interesting accomplishments of Frank's career is the fact that he has umpired high school playoff
games for seven straight years, in both North Carolina and Colorado.
He has been an advisor to the top umpire groups in the Denver Metro area having served as President
of the Rocky Mountain Umpires Association, and sat on the board of directors of the Rocky Mountain
Sports Officials Association. He was also a member of the Colorado Baseball Umpires Association
Executive Committee.
When not tied up in committee meetings, Frank also has seen action on the softball diamond. As a
member of the Amateur Softball Association, he has worked nine state tournaments and four regional
tournaments. The Denver Recreation Department also tabbed Frank to conduct umpire training
clinics.
When Frank retired from active umpiring, his involvement in athletics didn't end. Many veteran
umpires remember Frank coaching at several schools in the Metro League. He guided his girls
basketball teams to two state tournaments, and was named Metropolitan League Coach of the Year in
1990 and 1991, as well as Denver Post Coach of the Year in 1990. As a baseball coach, Frank was
Metropolitan League Coach of the Year in 1995. The crowning achievement of his coaching career was
his election into the Metropolitan League Hall of Fame.
Frank has been very active with youth outside of his duties as a teacher and a coach having worked as
a camp counselor and recreation director. He graduated from Regis High School and received his
degree from Regis College (BA Sociology/PE). He holds a Colorado Teaching Certificate with
endorsements in elementary education and junior high mathematics. Frank is currently teaching and
coaching at Elbert High School and makes his home in Elbert, Colorado with his wife, Nancy.
