2013 Hall of Fame Inductee Tom â€œTozzi" Smith - Boulder, Colorado
Nominated by Chuck Smith Presented by Dick Piland
Tom Smith was born in Flint, Michigan and now resides with his wife Hilary in Superior, Colorado. They
have 2 children, Alannah Rose Blaze and Jenna Hilary Smith. Tom attended St. Michael's High School in
Flint where he lettered 7 times: 2 for football playing quarterback, 3 for baseball as catcher, and 2 for
basketball as guard. He graduated from St. Bernard in Cullman, Alabama with a Bachelors in English
Literature in 1966, where he also played 2 years of baseball. He went on to grad school at Eastern
Michigan University with studies in Physical Education, M.S. Health and Recreation. His post grad
education was at the University of Colorado where he obtained a Type D Administration Certificate.
Tom's career began at Father Lopez High School in Daytona Beach, Florida where he taught English and
was the Head Baseball Coach, Assistant Football and Basketball coach for 3 years. He went on to Boulder
High School teaching English, Assistant Baseball, Basketball, and Head Swimming Coach for 4 years. His
next move was to Fairview High School teaching English as Department Chair, JV Baseball, Dean of
Students, Athletic/Activities Director for 26 years. Tom's current assignment of 3 years is at Holy Family
High School where he is Dean of Students, AP and Athletic Director.
Tom was a baseball umpire for 40 years from 1972 until 2012. During that time, he was in 4 State
Championship Finals and 6 Semi-Finals. Tom was President of CHSBUA from 1995 until 1997 and won
the Ken Furman Memorial Award in 2004. He has also been a softball umpire for 25 years, continues
today, and has been in 4 Finals and 4 Semi-Finals. He was a Basketball Referee for 25 years also engaged
in Finals and Semi-Finals and continues as Secretary/Treasurer from 2011 to present.
Mr. Smith has been awarded into the Michigan High School Athletic Association Hall of Fame, the
Michigan High School Football Coaches Hall of Fame, and is a Charter Member of the Flint Sports Hall of
Fame.
While Tom is very skilled and productive in all areas, his greatest passion is believed to be officiating. He
started umpiring when an additional income for his family was essential and retired some 40 years later
with the challenges and pride of accomplishment as his motivators. He expanded tasks to include
basketball, and later softball. Tom routinely rushed from a busy day teaching and/or administrating at
one school, to officiating a key game (after a rushed drive) at another school. He reveled in being able to
provide a quality service in a very difficult profession.
He would wear the pride of a job well done as well as the torture on a call missed. No coach, player or
fan ever lived or died any game more passionately than Tom. Even in his retirement he confesses to
missing the adrenalin flow of calling a crucial game. It is hard for him to just sit and watch a game and
enjoy it the way he did for so long, either behind the plate or on the bases. With his long resume of
working far into the playoffs, it is obvious others have been impressed by his credentials.
The biggest influence in Tom's life was his father, Tom Smith Sr, as he was to thousands of students and
athletes. He was a legendary coach and teacher at Flint St. Michael's for 38 years. His mother and father
were married for 63 years and died within 11 days of each other. In Tom's words, "They instilled the
values and principles that I continue to live by."
