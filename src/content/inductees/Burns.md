**T. Mitchell Burns Jr.** was a towering figure in Colorado's sports history, remembered as much for his love of the game as for his remarkable longevity on the field. Known to generations of high school athletes as “the oldest umpire they’d ever seen,” Burns exuded a dignified presence and deep respect for sportsmanship.

In the spring of 1972, before a freshman baseball game at JFK High School, Coach Dennis Sullivan introduced Burns to his players with a mix of reverence and playful exasperation—an indication that Burns was something more than just a longtime umpire. That impression stuck with many.

Born June 14, 1901, in Denver, Burns graduated from the University of Denver and married Helen Hudson on his birthday in 1929. He was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 1932 and operated T. Mitchell Burns Insurance Agents until retiring in 1980.

His passion for sports knew no bounds. A 1974 *Denver Post* feature highlighted just a few of his remarkable achievements:
- Umpired over 5,000 games at various levels since 1920
- Attended every national AAU basketball tournament for three decades
- Held season tickets to University of Denver football for 40 years
- Owned Denver Broncos season ticket priority number 8
- Attended every World Series for 32 years
- Saw 20 MLB All-Star Games
- In one whirlwind October day in 1959, he attended an Air Force football game in Denver, flew to Buffalo for a minor league championship, caught an NHL exhibition that night, and then flew to New York for the next day’s World Series opener

Burns passed away on October 25, 1985, at age 84. His obituary in the *Rocky Mountain News* fittingly began with: "long-time baseball umpire and sports enthusiast in the Denver area." His legacy endures not only in box scores and memories, but in the spirit of amateur sports across Colorado.
