After graduating from East High School in 1944, Don went into the Navy for two and a half
years. When he was released from the Navy, he played pro baseball for six years. During this

Don assisted Bill Reed, the Denver Bear's radio announcer as. his color man in 1956 and
1957. While attending East High School he umpired for the Old Timers League during the
summer and his call to fame came when an umpire for the Denver Bears became ill and he
was called to take over. Warren Spahn was the opposing coach and conflict over a call made
by Don in left field became an issue. We still laugh at that one! From 1954-1974, he coached
Youth Baseball and Legion A for Burt Chevrolet and one year of semi-pro baseball.
Don was a member of the Big Brothers for 5 years and served on the Board.
Ryne Duren (MLB relief pitcher) and Don started the Ryne Duren Celebrity Golf
