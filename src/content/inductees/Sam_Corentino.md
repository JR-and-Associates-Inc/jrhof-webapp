Sam Corsentino attended Lakeside/Vineland HS (now Pueblo County H.S.) graduating in 1936. He
began participating actively in softball and boxing during his teenage years. Sam played for 10
years on local, city, and inter-city leagues in basketball, baseball and softball. He spent 10 seasons
as the head men/women softball coach at the Pueblo Army Depot and was an assistant boxing
coach (five years) and an assistant coach for two years on the 29th Ammunition Squad.
Sam was named the District IV Commissioner of Babe Ruth 16/18-year-old division. He served as
Assistant State Commissioner for Colorado Babe Ruth Baseball Association. Sam was a two-year
member of the Runyon Field Board of Directors (1977-79). He volunteered to help the Special
Olympics and served 10 years as a volunteer Director for Pueblo Diversified Industries (helping
people who are mentally handicapped). Sam was said to be a small man in stature but big enough
to stand up to any player or coach who challenged any of his decisions. His greatest attribute was
his impartiality when officiating. He took his job seriously and called the plays as he saw them but
always according to the book. Sam received a Life Time Membership into the Greater Pueblo
Sports Association (GPSA) in 2008
