A proud graduate of Broomfield High School, Bert Borgmann dedicated his career to championing high school athletics and activities in Colorado. His journey began in the sports information offices at Colorado State University and the University of Northern Colorado, before embarking on a decades-long career with CHSAA.

Over his tenure, Bert oversaw nearly every CHSAA-sanctioned sport as well as music, becoming a cornerstone of the organization. Revered for his institutional knowledge and passion for storytelling, Bert became the caretaker of CHSAA’s rich history and a trusted leader within the Association and at the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS).

Former CHSAA commissioner Bob Ottewill praised Bert’s character, saying, “He never hesitated to take on any assignment – from basketball czar to snow shoveling duties – and did so with enthusiasm, a desire to learn and improve, and an uncommon ability to work with athletes, coaches, officials, event managers, and even parents.”

Nationally, Bert served with distinction on numerous committees, including chairing the NFHS National Records Committee and contributing to the NFHS Baseball and Softball Rules Committees, Sportsmanship Committee, and National High School Hall of Fame Screening Committee. He also helped institutionalize the annual sports information directors gathering at the NFHS summer meeting — a tradition that fostered community and camaraderie across the country.

Bert's commitment and excellence earned him numerous accolades, including:
- The Jim Saccomano Award (National Football Federation – Colorado Chapter)  
- The Ray Lutz Award (Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference)  
- Induction into the Colorado Dugout Club Hall of Fame  
- The NFHS Section 6 “Citation Award”  
- Lifetime Honorary Membership in the IAABO Board 4  

“His heart was so big. Bert was everyone’s biggest cheerleader and he helped make CHSAA what it is today,” said a colleague. “He was an incredible advocate for high school athletics, activities, and media. His legacy will live on for many years to come.”
