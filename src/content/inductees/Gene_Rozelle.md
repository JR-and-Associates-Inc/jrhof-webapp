# Hall of Fame Inductee Gene Rozelle — Grand Junction, Colorado

Gene Rozelle was born in Danbury, Nebraska, and moved to Grand Junction as a child, where he attended local schools and graduated from Central High School in 1947. Shortly after graduation, Gene proudly served his country in the U.S. Air Force, spending four years stationed in France before returning to the Grand Valley.

Gene’s passion for sports shaped his life and career. He became the beloved **“Voice of JUCO,”** serving as the radio play-by-play announcer for nearly four decades. His dedication and distinctive voice brought countless games to life, including every tournament game during his tenure.

In recognition of his tremendous contributions, a plaque honoring Gene hangs in the press level of the Tower at Suplizio Field, and the baseball broadcast booth there proudly bears his name — the **“Gene Rozelle Broadcast Booth.”**

Beyond his broadcasting legacy, Gene was known for his love of sports, his enjoyment of bingo, and his quiet moments spent fishing and painting. His lifelong dedication to the community and the game of baseball left an enduring mark on the Colorado baseball and umpiring world.
