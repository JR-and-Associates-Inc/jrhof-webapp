Hall of Fame Inductee Terry Schiessler – Aurora
A fundamental pillar in Colorado baseball history, Terry Schiessler was integrally involved in all aspects
of high school athletics from the early 1960s through the 80s. His passion was baseball.
A three-sport all-state star from Nebraska, Terry came to Colorado and the University of Denver on a
basketball scholarship but ended up being a standout in both football and baseball. Upon graduation, he
was drafted by both the St. Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Eagles, but chose to begin his career in the
Aurora Public Schools system in 1958.
After starting his baseball coaching career at Aurora Central as a junior varsity coach, Terry became the
inaugural head coach at Aurora Hinkley. After starting with all underclassmen, he led the Thunderbirds
to three consecutive Centennial League championships and state playoff berths with a 72-26 record.
In 1968, he was named the National District 7 High School Coach of the Year and managed the Suburban
All-Stars in the annual Denver-Suburban game. Terry took time to complete his master's degree and
became the first head coach at Metropolitan State College.
Terry’s focus turned to administration where he became the athletic director at Aurora Central and
Northglenn high schools. He also served as manager in the Basin League in South Dakota from 1967-
74. He coached players such as John Stearns, Paul Splitorff and Bob Apodaca. In 1975, he coached the
Arvada Dons.
Terry also was a top-notch football, basketball and baseball official and was a fixture on the sidelines
while working the "chain gang" for the Denver Broncos. He officiated state finals in all three high school
sports and moved into the college level where he worked several years at the National Junior College
Baseball World Series in Grand Junction. He also was the president of the Colorado High School Baseball
Umpires Association from 1977 – 1979 and served on executive boards in basketball and football. He
has been inducted in myriad hall of fames.
