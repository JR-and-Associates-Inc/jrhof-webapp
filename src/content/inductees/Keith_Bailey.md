Keith Bailey is the finest umpire that CHSBUA has ever produced. He has an exceptional resume both as
a player, umpire, and administrator. He served as an Denver Area Director and CHSBUA State President
from 1991 to 1993. He was a founding member of the Colorado Collegiate Umpire Association, authored
the first CHSBUA umpire instructional handbook which became the blueprint for the Mile-High
Advanced Umpire Clinic, helped draft the initial proposal (accepted by the CHSBUA Executive
Committee) for the Umpire Training, Evaluation, and Promotion (UTEP), and was a highly sought-after
speaker and clinician at many CHSBUA Master Clinics.
As a ballplayer, few Colorado baseball players can compare. After a stellar prep career for Hinkley High
School under the legendry John DiSiato, Keith enrolled at The University of Northern Colorado and
pitched Tom Petroff's Bears into the NCAA College World Series. He played professionally for the San
Francisco Giants and served as a professional scout for Chicago Cubs. As an administrator, Keith served
as the umpire coordinator for both the United States Air Force Academy and The University of Northern
Colorado. He also coordinated umpire assignments for the Cherry Creek Diamond Club for many years.
Keith has been a distinguished CHSBUA representative in nearly every high school tournament there is.
He worked CHSBUA post-season for nine years including three state championship games. He was
tabbed by the American Baseball Congress (AABC) for many post-sea-son assignments including The
Connie Mack Colorado State Championships, High Plains Regionals, and five straight appearances at The
Connie Mack World Series in Farmington, New Mexico. He also was tabbed for post-season duties at the
next level of competition and worked Colorado Stan Musial post-season games for seven years
culminating in his appointment to the Stan Musial World Series in Battle Creek, Michigan. He was named
the AABC National Umpire of the Year in 1994.
At the collegiate level, Keith has no peer in the state. Again, his curriculum vitae is second to none. He
has worked top collegiate conferences including the Western Athletic Conference, The Mountain West
Conference, The Big XII Conference, The Pacific 10, and the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference. Keith
was selected to work the National JUCO World Series, The WAC championships (1997). The MWC
championships (2002-2011), and 11 straight NCAA Division 1 Regional Tournaments.
Keith's international experience includes Team USA vs. Japan (Mile High Stadium 1984), the USA
Olympic Baseball Festival (1995), and Team USA v. Cuba in front of a record-setting 66,000 fans (Mile
High Stadium 1990). Keith was also tabbed by professional baseball having worked as a AAA alternate
for 13 years and the Colorado Rockies v. Colorado Springs Sky Sox (1996).
Besides Keith's Hall of Fame honor tonight, he was also named to the UNC Athletics Hall of Fame in
1974. He is currently the City of Aurora Parks and Recreation Supervisor for Youth Development. He is
married to Marlis (37 years), has two grown children, Jeff and Korri (John Treaes), twin grandsons Josh
and Matt and granddaughter Abby
