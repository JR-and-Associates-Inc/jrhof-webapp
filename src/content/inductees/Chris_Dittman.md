2000 Hall of Fame Inductee Chris Dittman â€“ Westminster
Chris Dittman began umpiring high school baseball in 1972. 16 years later he retired as an active
umpire having been elected to work eight state baseball tournaments, including four state
championship finals at the 5A level. In between, he was recognized as one of the top arbiters in the
Denver Metro area having been selected as the Baseball Official of the Year by the Jefferson County
Athletic League.
He was also a charter member of the Collegiate Baseball Umpires Association (1979) and remained an
integral part of that association for nine years. During Chris' tenure as an active umpire, he helped
train, recruit and advise many of the current men in blue who comprise the Colorado Collegiate
Umpire Association. Chris jokingly refers to himself as an "idol" to one member of that group in
particular. It was his guidance and support as one of the respected veterans which was instrumental
in the formation of the CCUA, the organization from which Rocky Mountain Athletic Association
umpires are selected, as well as arbiters working The Mountain West Conference, Western Athletic
Conference and Big XII Conference.
After Chris hung up his gear as an umpire, he moved into the coaching ranks as the Head Coach of
Regis University, and also assumed the position of Director of Athletics. As an Athletic Director, Chris
was an important voice in the formation of the RMAC baseball conference which opened up many
opportunities for outstanding Denver umpires to move into the collegiate ranks.
Professionally, Chris has come full circle. After a stellar career at Westminster High School, he
attended Wichita State University (BA 1967) and The University of Colorado (MA 1971). He taught at
Ranum High School and Coached baseball (circa 1975). He returned to "Westy" as athletic director and
is currently the principal at Westminster High School.
