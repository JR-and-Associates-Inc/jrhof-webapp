Hall of Fame Inductee Dick Yates – Denver
Denver South and Kennedy high schools and American Legion coach Dick Yates began a legacy
that has continued today. A Denver native, Dick attended South High School and the University
of Denver before landing as a teacher and coach in the Denver Public Schools system. He
became the head baseball coach at John F. Kennedy when the school opened in 1966. Dick
officially retired in 1985 after 35 years, 22 years as a head coach in baseball and football.
His baseball teams captured 18 city championships, eight state championships and two regional
championships, including play in summer American Legion baseball. Dick entered the Colorado
Sports Hall of Fame in 2007.
Dick’s sons Scott and Shannon and grandson Rich have carried on the tradition. Scott, who
played on a JFK state football championship team and went on to play at the University of
Colorado, is now the head football coach at Kent Denver where his son Rich plays. Shannon
starred on the 1986 Kent Denver team and went on to play at the United States Air Force
Academy.
