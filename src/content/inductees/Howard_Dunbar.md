1997 Hall of Fame Inductee Howard Dunbar â€“ Cheyenne, Wyoming
The late Howard Dunbar began his career as a sports official during a tour of duty with the U.S. Air
Force, then called the Army Air Corps, shortly after the end of World War II. During this time, he
served as Sports Commissioner for baseball, softball, basketball, and volleyball for U.S. personnel.
Upon his transfer to Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, he continued to officiate high school sports in
Wyoming as well as working in Nebraska and Colorado.
Howard also worked in the Western Athletic Conference as a football official. After a career spanning
59 years, Howard retired from officiating after a career which saw him work softball for 50 cents per
game (1934; the sport's second year) and where he assisted in the founding of the Eastern Wyoming
Sports Officials Association (in 1980).
His legacy to the sport also includes the naming of a sports facility in his honor. Dunbar Field was
created by Cheyenne City Council resolution in 1994 in honor of Howard's "outstanding citizenship
and contributions of time, energy and spirit to improve the quality of life in Cheyenne through its
sporting activities."
Howard died December 30, 1993 and is survived by his wife, Gwen and a family of two girls and one
boy.
