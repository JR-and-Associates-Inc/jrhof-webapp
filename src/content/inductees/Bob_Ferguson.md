1999 Hall of Fame Inductee Bob Ferguson – Fort Collins
Bob Ferguson has umpired it all from T-Ball all the way up through College. He also umpired in all
kinds of weather, just like the mailman, in snow, rain, wind and sunshine. One of Bob’s favorite stories
about windy games was one year at Rocky Mountain High the wind was blowing so strong that two
sheets of 4x8 Cellotex came flying across the field. Needless to say, the game was called.
Another memorable day was back in the early 70's, Bob was working the plate for a game between
Poudre & Boulder and when he went down to cover a play at 3rd base, he fell flat on his face. Bob
have worked numerous state playoff games. He was Northern Area Director for a number of years.
Over the years, Bob worked with the Ft. Collins Park and Recreation in their athletic programs. He
retired from teaching and umpiring about the same time in 1989. Bob was responsible for bringing
Mike Brady into umpiring.
Bob kept busy in retirement by driving a city bus 3 days a week and working for a drywall company.
