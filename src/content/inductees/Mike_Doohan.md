**2022 Hall of Fame Inductee – Boulder, Colorado**

Mike Doohan describes his officiating journey as simply “stumbling across an opportunity”—but what followed was a distinguished three-decade career that shaped a generation of CHSBUA umpires.

His start came in 1982, when veteran umpire Gene Crusan recruited him off a softball field in Commerce City with a humble offer: umpire a nine-year-old softball game for eight dollars. Mike accepted, and a lifelong passion was born.

Soon after, Mike joined the CHSBUA umpire group in Boulder and came under the mentorship of two iconic figures: Ken Furman and Doug Graham. These seasoned umpires, both CHSBUA Boulder Area Directors and Executive Committee members, helped guide Mike’s early development. Four years into his career, he attended the prestigious Harry Wendelstedt Professional Umpire School, returning to Boulder to elevate the game with renewed skill and dedication.

Mike not only excelled on the field—being selected to umpire in 25 consecutive post-season assignments, including 15 state tournament contests—but also off the field, where he followed his mentors into leadership. He became Boulder Area Director in the early 1990s and later served on the CHSBUA Executive Committee.

As an area director, Mike’s philosophy was clear: keep officials engaged and positive. His efforts introduced a new era of professionalism, bringing structured, professional-level training to amateur umpires. Rejecting anecdotal habits of the past, he emphasized sound fundamentals—creating a blueprint still followed by CHSBUA area directors today.

In the process, Mike built lasting relationships and earned a reputation as both a mentor and a model of what great officiating leadership looks like.

Mike Doohan didn’t just take advantage of an opportunity—he transformed it into a legacy.
