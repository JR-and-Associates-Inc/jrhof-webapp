2004 Hall of Fame Inductee Earl "Bud" Schoepflin – Westminster
Bud was born and raised in the Denver area. He joined the Marine Corp. and served from
1951 thru 1954 in a helicopter squadron. He also spent some of his time in the gymnasium
weight room lifting weights and exercising which he still enjoys today. He emphasizes the
importance of staying fit for all sports officiating and giving the kids your best shot. He had
the reputation of whipping your butt if you got out of line for questioning his decision, but
always listened to your explanation (and then threaten to whip you again!). His nickname
became "Popeye" or the guy with the big "Pipes”
.
Bud served as a state officer for the baseball umpires association as well as the football
officials association. He also served as the assigner for the WAC and RMAC. His affiliation
with the American Legion State Tournaments involved many trips around the state of
Colorado to participate in/and speak to tournament dignitaries at a gathering the evening
before the games would begin. He would then umpire games and evaluate other umpires
who worked with him.
Bud graduated from St. Joe's High School in Denver, Colorado in 1951. Bud married Bev on
5/15/53, in Denver. Together they have six children and many grandchildren, not to
mention all his friends.
Undoubtedly Bud's biggest contribution was that of a Mentor to other officials. He had a
knack of knowing how to speak to coaches, players, and other participants. You would not
only figure out a 'new' method of communication, but would share it with others. Bud has a
'true, hard & honest' work ethic and attitude. No one was fairer with all participants
involved with the game of baseball. BASEBALL IS BETTER BECAUSE OF BUD!
Bud's honors include being selected for approximately 22 State High School Tournaments in
all classifications as well as numerous American Legion and Connie Mack State and regional
tournaments. At the college level Bud umpired the Big 8 Conference for 10 years, RMAC for
12 years, WAC for 11 years including California and Hawaii and the JUCCO World Series
Tournament in Grand Junction for 14 years.
