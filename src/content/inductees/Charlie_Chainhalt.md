1992 Hall of Fame Inductee Charlie Chainhalt – Denver
Charlie Chainhalt is a guy who has been around the block. He was a standout athlete at Denver Manual
High School and went on to play baseball for the Colorado Teacher's College (University of Northern
Colorado). He was signed to a professional contract by the Legendary Cobe Jones, who was scouting for
the Giants.
Charile's major league debut with Charlotte, in the Carolina League. He later played briefly with the New
York Giants long enough to “catch on to a few tricks” as he puts it.
He returned to Denver in 1946 and became a player-coach for Joe Alpert's in the old Metro Denver Semi-
professional League. He recalls playing at Merchant's Park in the Denver Post Tournament and hitting
against Satchel Palge. *I fouled one ball, that was It.”
Charlie coached the 1977-78 National Championship team Axom Auto Company handled the likes of big
leaguers Nick Capra and John Stearns. Charlie was fiery and feisty and gets things fired up. He has been
known to have a few choice words for those who raise his ire.
Charlie's outlook on the game sums it up "Baseball has always been a pleasure and also a job. I enjoy
being around the kids.”
