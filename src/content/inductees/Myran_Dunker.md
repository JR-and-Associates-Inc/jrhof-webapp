Myran Dunker was born in Missoula, Montana and raised in Akron, Colorado where he
graduated high school. The U.S. Air Force, which he served honorably from 1980 to 2000, took
him to Buckley ANG Base in Aurora and then to Peterson AFB in Colorado Springs. He began
officiating basketball in 1976 and baseball in 1988. During this time, he also had the opportunity
to officiate three State Final Baseball Games.
He contributed to the CHSAA baseball program in multiple ways. First, he served as the Colorado
Springs Area Director from 1996 to 2004 and then as CHSBUA President from 2005 to 2007. He
capped off his umpiring career as President of the Colorado Springs Umpires Association from
2011 to 2016.
Myran revised the Colorado Springs Training Program to be a more functional and educational
experience for new umpires. This impressive training program is now the basis for current
training. CHSBUA New Umpire Training continues to be one of the best training programs in the
state of Colorado. Myran also established an evaluation program using senior umpires.
