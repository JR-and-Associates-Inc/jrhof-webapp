Terry Garvey graduated in 1966 from Hinkley High School where he played for the
renowned Terry Schiessler. He attended Mesa Junior College in Grand Junction. After school
at Mesa Terry came home hoping to find a coaching job in the Aurora American Legion
program. A former coach of Terry's and an umpire as well, Bob Finney had other ideas and
got Terry started in umpiring youth baseball games.
This started a career that lasted nearly 40 years. Terry had some terrific men in his career
that helped him along the way. His rules mentor in those early days was Dave Letofsky who
would meet with Terry and others for hours over his kitchen table going over the rules of
the game. Mert Letofsky gave Terry his start in college baseball working in the RMAC in the
early 1980's. Terry continued working college baseball in the area for the next 20 years. He
worked in the RMAC and WAC. One of Terry's memories was working a Grand Canyon vs
Denver University game that was something like 46-12. Terry recalls that the DU catcher
had 13 RBI's that day.
Terry worked numerous state playoffs over the years in high school baseball. His summer
baseball tourney history is long and storied. He worked his first A legion State
championship with Joe Rossi and Terry Schiessler. Numerous state and regional Legion and
AABC tourneys would follow over the years.
Terry was one of the original "A" teamers that in the early 1980's helped form the Colorado
Collegiate Baseball Association in. In 1984, Terry was selected to umpire the USA Olympic
Team vs Japan that played at Mile High Stadium. Terry, along with Keith Bailey, are the only
2 men who played at Mile High and umpired a game at the stadium as both played in the
Denver Suburban All Star games as High School Seniors. Terry also umpired in the MLB
Legends Baseball game.
Terry's career brought many a smile to players and coaches and partners who graced the
baseball fields across the Front Range. In particular, the nights at Aurora Central, Littleton,
Lowry Air Force Base and Fitzsimmons Army Fields and the endless days at Cherry Creek,
Hinkley and Gateway High Schools where Terry spent so many memorable games.
Terry has been married for 46 years to Donna and has two sons, Michael and Caz and is
grandpa to three grandchildren.
