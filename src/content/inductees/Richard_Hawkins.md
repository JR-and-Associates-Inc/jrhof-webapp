2001 Hall of Fame Inductee Richard Hawkins – Aurora
Richard Hawkins is a man who has seen a lot of action, both on and off the baseball field.
"Hawk" is a veritable treasure trove of American Military History having seen action in
three major wars, from World War II to Korea to Vietnam. Although most of his umpiring
brethren were used to seeing him in the standard blue uniform of the umpire. Hawk's
comrades in arms knew him best as a top-drawer Chief Master Sergeant who served our
country for 28 years in The United States Air Force. Hawk turned to the "Wild Blue Yonder"
after a four-year hitch in the United States Army during which he saw action as a machine
gunner in the European Theatre of Operations, from D-Day to V-E Day and every other day
in between.
Hawk's reasons for turning in his combat fatigues for the Air Force blues, 54 years ago, did
not suggest his love of baseball. As Hawk recalls, it was during a break in the overcast
during his involvement in the famous Battle of the Bulge when the Air Force was able to
resupply and provide air support to a combat ground force slugging it out with the Nazis.
"They really saved our asses that day," Hawk recalled, explaining his switch to the Air Force.
With Hawk's Army Air Corps enlistment came his involvement with baseball. Hawk’s career
from Army machine gunner, to flyboy umpire came in 1950 when he was stationed at Scott
Air Force Base where he saw slightly less hazardous duty working the Clinton County
Baseball League. It was not long until an overseas military assignment prompted his entry
into military and local Japanese College baseball and three appearances at the Far East
World Series, armed with only a plate brush and ball-strike indicator, in 1952.
After attending the George Barr Umpire School in Japan, Hawk returned stateside and
worked as a Florida State League reserve umpire. Another transfer sent Hawk to California
where he worked high school, college, and semi-pro ball before being sent half a world away
where he worked baseball in Okinawa from 1960-64. A highlight of Hawk's Okinawa tour
was his assignment to the Detroit Tigers vs. Military All-Stars game in 1961. After Hawk
conquered Okinawa, he returned to California and a successful high school and college
career where he was selected to work the CIF Baseball Championships. A quick tour in
Vietnam was followed by more California baseball and another CIF Championship
assignment.
Hawk finally made it to Colorado in 1976 and distinguished himself as a top arbiter working
high school and Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference baseball. For many years Hawk was a
fixture in the Men’s Senior Baseball League as well as local legion baseball. In 1992, Hawk
was drafted again into international service working Olympic Baseball when Team USA
battled Team Cuba at Denver's Mile High Stadium in front of a record crowd of over 66.000.
On a much smaller scale, but equally as important, Hawk worked high school playoffs in
virtually every league in the Denver Metro Area for over 25 years. He served as the Denver
Director for CHSBUA, was a valuable clinician at CHSBUA Master Clinics, and was a "Top
Sergeant" for many new umpires and got them through their first battle action on the
baseball diamond. Hawk is still active as an evaluator for CHSBUA and lives in Aurora with
his wife Doris.
