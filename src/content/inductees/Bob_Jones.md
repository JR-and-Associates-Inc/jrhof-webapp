2013 Hall of Fame Inductee Bob Jones â€“ Kansas City, MO
Bob retired from the Kansas City, Missouri Police Department in 1995. He currently works
at Raytown Middle School in KC. Bob and his wife Debbie have been married for 38 years
and have 2 children, Bryan, and Kristen.
Bob Jones began his officiating career in 1978 working High School games and the MLB.
From 1979 through 1991, Bob worked every Big 8 and Big 12 tournament game played -
121 straight playoff games. In 1991 Bob became 1st Supervisor for the Big 8 and eventually
Big 12. He held that position until 1996. In 2001 he became the Coordinator of Umpires for
the Missouri Valley Conference. His distinguished career includes 15 NCAA Division 1
Regionals - Super Regionals and 3 NCAA Division 1 College World Series. He has continued
to work the Mile High Camp since 1980.
Bob first came to Denver as the NCAA Regional Advisor/Evaluator. He is responsible for
helping 3 CHSBUA members gain assignments into the NCAA Division 1 post-season. More
than that, he planted the seed which eventually grew into the Mile-High Advanced Umpire
Clinic and the UTEP Program as three individuals, with Bob's guidance, began the umpire
development program, which has become the hallmark of excellence for over 25 years.
Without Bob's input and continued participation, the clinic would have never prospered
and become the successful event it is today, nor would have the UTEP training program
ever gotten off the ground. Bob has helped train virtually 75 percent of the CHSBUA
umpires registered in Denver. His proficiency in all phases of umpiring, from mechanics to
handling situations, helped over 300 umpires increase their ability and raise the ability level
of the entire Colorado High School Baseball Umpires Association. He is a trusted advisor,
excellent teacher, and friend to all the umpires in the CHSBUA.
