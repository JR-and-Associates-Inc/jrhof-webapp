**Terry Reed has called thousands of games across decades — but his greatest victories came off the field.**

With a career spanning over 40 years, Terry Reed has become a pillar of Colorado’s officiating community. From district and regional matchups to the intensity of state championship games, Terry earned respect with every pitch, every call, and every show of quiet professionalism. His calm demeanor, sharp judgment, and deep knowledge of the game made him a trusted presence behind the plate and on the court.

**His impact was felt far beyond Colorado's borders.**  
In 2018, Terry was invited to umpire at the prestigious Dreams Park Tournament in Cooperstown, NY — a personal and professional highlight that allowed him to visit the National Baseball Hall of Fame. He’s also been awarded bronze, silver, and gold medals from ASA/USA Softball, holds National Indicator Fraternity honors, and has received multiple Umpire of the Year awards.

Born and raised in Kansas, Terry moved to Colorado in 1976. A player in both men’s fast pitch and slow pitch softball, he eventually found his true calling in officiating. Over the years, he became a versatile 3-sport official in baseball, softball, and basketball under CHSAA, and also served two terms as a softball area director. Off the field, he’s a proud husband to Penny (married since 1977), father to three daughters, and grandfather to six.

> ***“Terry’s character has always been his strongest trait,”***  
> says fellow official and longtime friend.  
> ***“Even in the toughest moments, you could count on him to show up with strength, faith, and grace.”***

## **A Fight Bigger Than the Game**

In 2023, Terry faced an opponent tougher than any he’d seen on the field: cancer. After experiencing severe abdominal pain, doctors discovered a tumor in his hip and pelvis — bone cancer that had originated in his kidney. The diagnosis was dire. Terry stepped away from officiating, believing his time was short. CHSAA honored him at the 5A state championship with a ceremonial first pitch, surrounded by family, friends, and fellow officials.

But in true Terry Reed fashion, **he refused to quit.**  
Thanks to an experimental surgery and an indomitable spirit, Terry defied the odds. By mid-2023, he was walking and jogging again. By 2024, he was back on the field — whistle in hand, smile on his face.

## **Faith, Family, and the Future**

Terry credits his miraculous recovery to God, the unwavering love of his family, and the support of the officiating community. He continues to receive monthly treatments, with his cancer now in remission. Through it all, his perspective remains grounded in gratitude and hope.

> ***“I believe I’m here for a reason,”*** he says.  
> ***“There’s more to give, more to teach, and more to live.”***
