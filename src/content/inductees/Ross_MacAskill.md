2003 Hall of Fame Inductee Ross MacAskill – Colorado Springs
Ross MacAskill umpired across the United States starting in 1971 in Virginia, while he was
stationed with the USMC. Then in 1973-75 Umpire in California and finally finishing his
career in Colorado Springs from 1976-2002. Some of Ross’ accomplishments include the
Babe Ruth Regional 1980 World Series, Burlington Colorado, the 1983 Olympic Sports
Festival, Colorado Springs, and am Area Director for CHSBUA in 1987-88. Ross was a state
championship umpire for a couple of games in the late 1980’s as well as in 1992, 1994,
1997, 2002.
Some of Ross’ fondness memories were: the players who make it to the Major Leagues, the
weather challenges during the Colorado High School baseball season, the coaches who gave
so much to the players they coached, changing from an outside chest protector to an inside
protector, working the high school all-star games at Mile High Stadium and Coors Field, the
days when he thought triple headers were fun, believing that what he did was important
and made a difference, being a part of an avocation where integrity was critical, watching
his sons grow up to love the game of baseball, trying to do his best so that the boys who
played could do their best, the fine men who he was privileged to umpire with on the field,
still searching for the perfect game, and his wife watching him (anonymously) in the stands
at his first game in 1971 and at his last game in May 2002.
