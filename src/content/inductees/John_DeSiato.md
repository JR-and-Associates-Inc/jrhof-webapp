Hall of Fame Inductee John DeSiato – Denver
Still a fixture in Aurora, John DeSiato made his mark by coaching some of the best high school players in
Colorado history.
John, who still works as the manager of Aurora Public Schools Stadium, started out at Hinkley in 1969 as
an assistant coach under Terry Schiessler, whom he knew from their time together playing at the
University of Denver. John took over in the early ’70s and guided the team to Centennial League titles in
1972, 1973 (when the Thunderbirds lost in the semifinals, but placed third) and 1975.
The championship breakthrough came in 1979, when a team loaded with juniors who had played
together the previous season, finally put it together with Brian Fisher at the forefront.
In 11 seasons at Hinkley, John compiled a 140-71-1 record. He coached in the annual Denver Post
Suburban vs. Denver all-star game in 1972, 1973 and 1975.
He was selected District 7 Coach of the Year in 1979 by the American Association of College Baseball
Coaches.
John went on to coach the likes of future major leaguers Brian Holman and Danny Jackson.
He was born in Denver and played baseball at Denver North High School and the University of Denver.
John is married to Roseann, has two daughters and one son.
