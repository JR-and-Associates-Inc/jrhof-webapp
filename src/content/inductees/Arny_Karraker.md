Arny Karraker was born in Holyoke, Colorado in 1954 and now presides with his wife Patti in
Cortez, CO. He graduated from high school in 1972 after attending Montezuma Cortez High
School, RE-1. He then went on to attend Western State College in Gunnison, Colorado in 1972.
Arny has had the honor of being selected to umpire numerous District and Regional playoff
games in his 25 or so years of umpiring. He was selected to umpire a State Championship Game
in 2008 and has also umpired games in New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona, He has also umpired
Regional and State Championship Games for Connie Mack, AABC and Farmington, New Mexico.
Included as one of his many contributions as a leader, Arny has held the position of Area
Director in Cortez since the association was formed. He said it was "mostly because no one else
had the time for it" but not so sure of Arny. He has been involved with baseball on the local level
since 1985 (give or take a year of two.)
Arny Karraker always wanted to be the oldest active umpire in the state of Colorado. Sadly, his
health issues have forced him to step down from an active position.
