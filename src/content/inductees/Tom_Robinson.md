> “Beyond the impact Tom Robinson has made in this Association, our state and nationally over the course of his 30-plus year career as a coach, teacher, administrator, white hat referee, Hall of Famer, Big 12 replay expert, husband, father and grandfather, we are all better people for having had Tom in our lives,” said CHSAA commissioner Rhonda Blanford-Green.

Hired by former commissioner Bob Ottewill, Tom became the first African-American administrator in the history of CHSAA.

Over 20 years with the Association, Tom oversaw officials — becoming the first to assign a female official to a boys’ basketball Final Four — as well as the sportsmanship program, and boys’ and girls’ golf. A role model and respected leader, Tom was widely admired for his passion, integrity, and mentorship.

> “Tom was an inspiration in so many ways,” said CHSAA assistant commissioner Bethany Brookens. “He taught me how to play golf, he and Cleo taught us all about love and marriage, he taught me the mechanics of officiating, and he gave me loyal friendship and a deep respect for all people. An incredible, ethical, good man and mentor — I already miss him dearly.”

A graduate of Regis Jesuit High School, Tom attended Colorado State University where he played football, basketball, and track and field. He began officiating in the summer of 1969, and that same year started his teaching and coaching career at Regis Jesuit. He remained there for 31 years, serving as head basketball coach from 1983 to 1993, before joining CHSAA in 2001.

Tom and his wife, Cleo Parker Robinson, were married for 51 years. Tom stood as a stalwart behind the scenes of Cleo's dream: the formation and rise of the nationally recognized Cleo Parker Robinson Dance (CPRD). As a co-founder, board member, and business manager, Tom contributed to every facet of the organization’s success.

Beyond CHSAA, Tom served as president of the National Association of Sports Officials and worked as the Big 12 Conference’s replay coordinator. He announced his retirement on December 15, 2021.

Tom’s passing leaves an enduring void, but his legacy of compassion, leadership, and service lives on.

> “Even from the outside looking in, Tom was a person to aspire to be,” said Rashaan Davis, CHSAA’s first assistant commissioner for activities. “He always seemed cool, calm, and collected — something I know I needed. Now, as a staff member, I understand that Tom laid the foundation for me, a Black male in this role, to be patient and to recognize all voices. Nobody did it better.”

Tom is survived by his wife, Cleo Parker Robinson; his son, Malik Robinson, executive director of CPRD; and his beloved grandchildren. He looked forward to playing golf with Cleo and being present in his grandchildren’s lives.
