Jim Paronto built a solid reputation as a football player and coach before becoming one of Colorado’s premier umpires. A multi-sport athlete, Jim played quarterback at Adams State University where he earned Academic All-Conference, Academic All-American, and All-Conference honors, while also playing on the baseball team. He graduated in 1966 after serving as team captain his senior year, and later returned to serve as the head coach for both football and baseball at his alma mater.

His career in coaching and officiating began at Central Union High School in California before he returned to Alamosa, Colorado to teach and coach at Monte Vista High School. Jim soon moved into the collegiate ranks with coaching roles at Adams State, Brigham Young University—where he helped the Cougars win a Division I National Championship and earned a doctorate in athletic administration—followed by positions at Oregon State and Colorado Mesa University. At CMU, he led the Mavericks to the NAIA football championship game in his first season.

In addition to his accomplishments in education and coaching, Jim established himself as one of the top umpires in the state. He served as CHSBUA President from 1999 to 2001 and co-directed the CHSBUA Umpire Training, Evaluation, and Promotion (UTEP) program. He was also instrumental in founding the Mile High Advanced Umpire Clinic, where he trained over 200 high school umpires across a decade of service.

Jim’s umpiring career was as extensive as it was distinguished. He worked countless league, regional, and state championships and was a fixture at the AABC Connie Mack World Series in Farmington, New Mexico. At the college level, he represented CHSBUA in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference and Scenic West Conference as both an umpire and supervisor, while also officiating in the WAC, MWC, and West Coast Conference. He later served as a coordinator in the MWC and held the position of NCAA Secretary Rules Editor for 12 years—the only CHSBUA umpire to ever serve in a national NCAA rules capacity.

A lifelong educator, coach, mentor, and leader, Jim Paronto is an exemplary figure whose career has left an indelible mark on Colorado high school and collegiate baseball. His induction into the Joe Rossi CHSBUA Hall of Fame is a tribute to his unwavering dedication and excellence in sport.
