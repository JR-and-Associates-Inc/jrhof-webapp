Dave “Chick” Baker’s journey began in the small town of Snyder, Colorado, but his impact has stretched across continents and generations. In 1960, while stationed in Aviano, Italy as a member of the United States Air Force, he became a registered official with the Italian Sports Federation. Rather than soaring in the “Wild Blue Yonder,” Baker found his calling grounded on baseball diamonds, basketball courts, and volleyball courts—where his versatility and passion truly shined.

Upon his final duty post at Lowry Air Force Base in Aurora, Colorado, Baker launched his Colorado officiating career in 1971—one that would span nearly fifty years and seven generations. Known for his consistency and professionalism, he officiated five state championship baseball games and numerous state football title contests. His reputation for excellence extended to basketball as well, where he contributed to 37 combined football and basketball postseason tournaments.

A true pillar of CHSBUA, Baker served as President from 1984 to 1987, contributed on the Executive Committee, and dedicated decades as Secretary/Treasurer. He played a key role in organizing Master Clinics and was instrumental in supporting Joe Rossi in establishing the Hall of Fame.

Dave “Chick” Baker exemplifies leadership, integrity, and dedication. His legacy is woven into the fabric of CHSBUA history, reminding us that from small-town beginnings come great and lasting contributions.
