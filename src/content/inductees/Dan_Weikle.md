To say that Dan Weikle’s ongoing umpiring career, which began in 1975, is saturated with
accomplishments would be an understatement. Dan’s focus as the CHSBUA President (2000-2003) was
to improve CHSBUA umpiring through on-going training and evaluation. His philosophy was simple; give
any CHSBUA umpire a path leading to the elevation of their talent; to meet and exceed expected
standards of performance. The creation of the advanced training and professional standards for
CHSBUA umpires was taken from the NCAA Umpire Development Program presented almost 40 years
ago when Dan and Keith Bailey attended the first NCAA National Umpire Development Meeting in
Kansas City, MO in the dead of winter. The next year this duo, with the help of Ray Belfiore, convinced
NCAA Umpire Development to come to Denver, knowing it was better to bring the training here rather
than have Colorado umpires brave the frozen hazards he and Bailey had endured on I-70 in January.
Dan took this a step further by inviting Jon Bible, the first NCAA Umpire Coordinator, to come to Denver
and meet with all interested umpires, some of whom were on the cusp of entering into the college
ranks, but most of whom were interested in improving their skills as CHSBUA umpires. Following an
open-invitation meet and greet dinner, Bible attended local Connie Mack and Stan Musial summer
games to observe some of Colorado’s best CHSBUA umpires. Fast forward a few years with Dan, Keith,
Ray, and Jim Paronto organizing The Mile High Advanced Umpire Clinic featuring instruction from the
finest nationally recognized umpires in America featuring Bob Jones, the first NCAA Umpire
Development representative assigned to the Mid-west who functioned much like Bible had done earlier.
The program eventually became a success with over two-thirds of CHSBUA umpires selected for high
school post-season games receiving continued professional development through the Mile High
Advanced Umpire Clinic.
While Dan’s resume never compared to many of the MHAUC grads, it was evident that his greatest
contribution was organizing opportunities for umpires to learn and develop their craft. Toward this end,
during the late 1980’s, Dan met with the AAA Denver Zephyrs general manager Tom Mahoney and
lobbied for the members of the advanced training clinic to be guests of the Zephyrs so they could watch
and learn from professional umpires. Dan’s request was for a game or two; the Zephyrs G.M. responded
with season passes for all umpires in the development program. Later, as a CHSBUA Area Director, Dan
successfully organized and scheduled Denver Area Umpire meetings to be held in a suite at Mile High
Stadium in conjunction with Zephyrs games.
During a career spanning six decades, Dan was responsible for creating several umpire instructional
clinics, both locally and nationally. The Mile High Advanced Umpire Camp was one of his first. After
developing the MHAUC and the Umpire Training, Evaluation, and Promotion (UTEP) arm of CHSBUA, Dan
went on to develop a national umpire training and evaluation program in his new (2010-16) position as
the NCAA Division II National Umpire Coordinator. Dan’s mandate from the NCAA was to insure the best
umpires from around the nation were observed, evaluated, and promoted to the eight Division II post-
season tournaments including the national championship. The creation of two separate NCAA clinics,
The Palm Beach Challenge in Florida and The Desert Challenge in Phoenix helped meet that mandate.
Both clinics featured first-ever Division II Regional Advisors headed by Tim Hatfield, Dennis Whalen, and
Kirk Knowles-all former MHAUC instructors and CHSBUA members, who were largely responsible for the
selection process leading to the naming of the NCAA Division II National Championship umpire staff.
