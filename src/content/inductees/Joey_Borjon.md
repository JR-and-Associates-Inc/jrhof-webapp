**2022 Hall of Fame Inductee – Pueblo, Colorado**

Joey Borjon was a beloved presence in Pueblo’s athletic community, known to nearly every student-athlete in the city. For over 30 years, he served as a security guard at Pueblo Central High School, and for even longer, he was a fixture on the baseball diamond—officiating for an impressive 32 state championship games.

Joey began his umpiring career in 1983 with the Pueblo study group of CHSBUA. His leadership soon became evident, and he was elected Pueblo Area Director, taking charge of umpire recruitment and training. A true year-round official, he also umpired high school softball and refereed basketball during the off-season.

In the summer months, Joey served as the Training Coordinator for umpires at the Runyon Field Sports Complex. He played a key role in mentoring umpires of all ages and managed assignments for the prestigious Tony Andenucio Memorial Classic.

Known for his crisp appearance, command of the rulebook, and unshakable calm under pressure, Joey earned the respect of coaches, players, and fellow officials across Southern Colorado. New and veteran umpires alike looked up to him as both an inspiration and a mentor.

Joey was perhaps best remembered for his signature promise at the pregame plate meeting:  
> “We will work hard for your teams this game!”

Above all, Joey cherished his family. He was a devoted husband to his loving wife, Rita, and a proud father to Ann, Josh, and Buddy—who followed in his footsteps as a high school baseball umpire. He was also a doting grandfather to Hannah, Brooklyn, Remi, Avery, and Bostyn.

Joey Borjon left a legacy of integrity, leadership, and heart—both on the field and at home.
