1990 Hall of Fame Inductee Julius “Julie” Carabello – Denver
Julius “Julie” Carabello was involved in baseball since growing up in Curtis Park and playing for Sacred
Heart Elementary School and Sacred Heart High School, where he graduated in 1935.
He continued his involvement with baseball when he coached St. Joseph’s High School before joining the
Navy to serve in World War II. The Navy recognized his talent and passion for athletics, assigning him
coaching duties for the Navy’s recreational basketball and baseball teams stationed in the Philippines
Islands. He coached a team anchored by Dom DiMaggio, among other outstanding players serving their
country.
After returning from his service in the Navy, he co-founded an organization called the Junior Parochial
League. The JPL provided organized athletics to Catholic elementary school students, many of whom
would eventually play for the Parochial League, Denver’s Catholic High School league. An iteration of the
JPL continues today, having thrived for nearly 70 years.
As the co-founder and longtime director of the JPL, he introduced innovations like girl’s sports, weight-
classifications to boys playing football, consolation brackets for the annual postseason basketball
tournament, and enrollment classifications to ensure competitive fairness. He was not only the face of
the JPL; his energy and commitment were the engine which drove the organization.
His passion for sports morphed into officiating and umpiring, resulting in an outstanding career as a
baseball umpire. Julie was rated the top umpire in the region, according to polls conducted by local and
regional college coaches. He umpired hundreds of games for the University of Colorado, as the Umpire
in Chief for longtime coaches Frank “Chief” Prentup and Irv Brown.
Other colleges he worked for were CSU, AFA, DU, Wyoming and UNC. When he wasn’t umpiring these
colleges, he worked for the Boulder Collegians, National Baseball Congress tournaments, Denver Post
Tournaments at Merchants Park, and an event he cherished, the Junior College World Series in Grand
Junction. He served as UIC for Sam Suplizio in the Junior College World Series for many years. He also
worked NCAA Regional Tournament games in Albuquerque and Salt Lake City.
Julie was invited to Florida to train as a professional umpire, but family obligations prevented him
pursuing this opportunity. But he found the thrill of calling balls and strikes for major league players in
exhibition games in Denver, when he was hired to umpire major league teams which annually played
exhibition games at Bears Stadium after they broke camp from spring training. He was the alternate
umpire for the Denver Bears, filling in occasionally for an injured or ill minor league umpire. He was also
the UIC for a barnstorming MLB “All Star” game which found its way to Denver a couple times in the
mid-1950s.
Julie founded and was the President of the Rocky Mountain Umpires Association for many years, leading
and enhancing the status and professional development of umpires across the Front Range. After Rocky
Mountain Umpires Association, Aurora Umpires and Umpires Association of Colorado combined, Julie
became the first president CHSBUA and presided from 1963 to 1975.
He was awarded a Pioneer Award by the Colorado Rockies in 1997, recognizing his impact on baseball in
Colorado. This award is a permanent enshrinement in the press room at Coors Field.
In addition to coaching, he was an area sub-scout for the Pittsburgh Pirates and the New York Mets for
close to two decades.
Carabello passed away in 2008, but his impact on baseball – especially umpiring - lives on today
