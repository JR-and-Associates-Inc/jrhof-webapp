1990 Hall of Fame Inductee Warren Kettner – Denver
Warren Kettner may have been born on a farm, but his true love became teaching and instructing
baseball and many other activities.
The native of Good Thunder, Minn., Warren’s educational base began forming at a young age. He
attended St. Paul's Lutheran Elementary School and Truman High School before enrolling into Lower
Columbia Junior College in Longview, WA.
After enlisting in the Army and serving two years in South Korea (1954-55), Warren returned to
Valparaiso (Ind.) University to finish his education (1959) where he majored in history. That same year,
he began teaching and coaching at Lutheran High School in Denver. He taught in the social science field-
geography, world history, international relations, economics and was the head of the physical education
department.
Warren then started becoming involved in many other areas, all sports related. He started the cross-
country and wrestling programs at Lutheran and organized and served as director of the sports medicine
program for 35 years. He was an assistant coach in basketball and football and served as the athletic
director for 10 years at Lutheran. While Warren’s involvement in school and outside activities were
intense, it was in baseball where he made his mark.
Warren became the head baseball coach at Lutheran in 1963 and was a fixture in the program for the
next 25 years. His highlights were numerous:
• Overall record—213 wins, 156 losses
