**A lifelong student of the game,** Ray Belfiore’s journey behind the plate began immediately after high school, when he took the Colorado high school umpiring test in 1982. In those formative years, he developed his craft alongside the respected Aurora-based crew led by Mert and Dave Letofsky. Starting in sub-varsity high school games, Ray quickly grew his skills through the rigors of the American Amateur Baseball Congress (AABC), calling games in the competitive Connie Mack (18+) and Stan Musial (collegiate) circuits.

**It wasn’t long before Ray was recognized as a standout new talent**. His professionalism, consistency, and dedication earned him numerous championship assignments and set him apart among his peers. Over 30 years, he became a fixture in these elite leagues.

In 1987, Ray took a major step forward by attending the *Brinkman Professional Umpire School***, an experience he credits as transformative. There, he learned what it truly takes to excel in the profession. Upon returning to Colorado, Ray brought that knowledge home, becoming an instructor at the CHSBUA-sponsored Mile High Advanced Umpire Clinic. He became a vital asset to the clinic, training not only aspiring umpires but also the instructors—sharing cutting-edge professional techniques and his personal blueprint for success: 

>***“Work hard every game, no matter the score. Listen to the veterans. Always be learning.”***
>
>**Ray's success continued to climb**, as he entered the collegiate officiating ranks with assignments in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (D-II) and major Division I conferences like the Mountain West, Big XII, WAC, and West Coast Conference. Though his high school schedule lessened over time, his passion for mentoring never waned. He remained a pillar of the CHSBUA’s instructional efforts for over two decades, particularly through the UTEP/Mile High Advanced Umpire Clinic and Master Clinics.
