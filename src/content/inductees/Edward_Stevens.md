1990 Hall of Fame Inductee Ed Stevens – Arvada
Ed Stevens began forming his legacy at a young age on the South Side of Chicago. Following the death
of his father, at the age of 13, he was forced to drop out of school to work full time to support his
mother and two brothers. When he was 19, his family moved to Golden.
Ed dedicated his life to softball and baseball. He played softball in one of the most competitive leagues
in Denver and eventually turned to umpiring and coaching.
For more than three decades, he was considered one of Colorado's top high school and college umpires.
He also was a nationally recognized ASA fast pitch softball umpire — becoming the only man to have
played (1957) and umpired (1971) in a national tournament.
He served many years as a member of the board of directors for AABC baseball and was commissioner
of many local leagues as well as tournament director for countless state and regional tournaments.
Ed was one of the pioneers of Arvada Junior Baseball. He coached his son's 10-year-old team as well as
B Legion team for Arvada High School. He also coached in the summers, winning back-to-back
American Legion state championships in 1980 and 1981 — a first in Colorado history.
