1996 Hall of Fame Inductee Jim Dorsey â€“ Littleton
Jim Dorsey umpired Colorado high school, American Legion and college baseball from 1961 to 1981.
His high school on-field experience includes 15 years of playoffs and three state tournaments, along
with several American Legion playoffs. He also worked the Western Athletic Conference, RMAC and
Denver University.
Jim left umpiring due to the workload in the Sheridan High School administration. He has served in
many capacities with CHSBUA, including Local Director, Executive Committee, Assignor and State
President from 1979 - 1981. Jim still observes/assesses over 40 games per season, assigns officials for
Metro League, and credits Julius Carabello for contributing the most to his umpiring career.
