1998 Hall of Fame Inductee Ken Furman â€“ Boulder
Ken Furman is perhaps the single most influential person the Colorado High School Baseball Umpire
Association has known. His unparalleled wealth of knowledge and experience, both as a coach,
umpire, and athletic administrator has helped to shape the direction the CHSBUA has taken as an
organization. His calming influence as both an advisor and mentor has guided the careers of many top
officials currently working today.
Ken has literally done it all, and has served with distinction in every capacity. His resume is indicative
of the respect and confidence he has engendered in those with whom he has been associated. Ken has
served in executive capacities as the President of The Colorado High School Coaches Association
(1970-71). The Boulder Valley Coaches Association, and The Colorado High School Baseball Umpires
Association (1981-84). He was appointed Colorado High School Baseball Rules Interpreter (1989-1997)
by the CHSBUA Board and was also a two-term Area Director for Boulder/Longmont study group.
As an official, Ken's career accomplishments have set a standard of unmatched achievement and
excellence. He has been selected to work 16 Colorado State High School tournaments in basketball
and has worked one NCAA Division I Regional Final (1986). He has been a fixture at the Colorado High
School Baseball Championships for 15 years, and was a charter member of The Colorado Collegiate
Umpire Association as well.
As an educator, Ken has been closely involved with student council and athletic administration. He is a
29-year member of NBA. CEA and the Boulder Valley Education Association. He is also a member of
Phi Delta kappa, and was listed in the 1956 edition of Who's Who in American Universities and
Colleges as an undergraduate at The University of Denver where he received his BA. Ken also holds an
MS University of Colorado (1976), as well as a Type D Administrator Certificate.
Tom Smith of Boulder, a CHSBUA Past President writes of Ken, "His professional leadership and
involvement has been the largest contributing factor on CHSAA and its programs. Ken's Total
involvement as a teacher, coach, sponsor. referee and umpire has had a positive effect on literally
thousands of young people and adults." A final, lasting tribute to Ken Furman occurred earlier this
year. Ken Furman was inducted into the CHSAA Hall of Fame.
