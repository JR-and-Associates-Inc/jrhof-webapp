Hall of Fame Inductee Melvin Martin – Commerce City
Mel Martin started his coaching career in La Jara where he was head baseball and head basketball coach
from 1949 through 1953. He took over the baseball program at Adams City in 1955 and was head coach
until 1977. During his reign, his teams won league championships in 1959 and 1962. They won
co-championships in 1960,1965, and 1966. The 1959 league championship was the first league
championship the school had won in any sport. In 1962, Mel was selected head coach in the annual
Denver Post Suburban vs. Denver All-Star Game won by the suburban’s, a first.
The 1977 season produced one of Mel’s biggest baseball honors. He went to Miami, Florida, to be
honored by the American Association of College Baseball for his many years of contribution to baseball.
Mel always set a good example for his players, and they had much respect for him. Many of his ball
players went on to continue their education and play college baseball. Some admired his work so much
that they became coaches. Many of those men received their early experiences by coaching in the Little
League program that Mel ran for many years.
Until the time of his death in 1981, he spent many hours of time working with youth and athletes of all
ages in the recreational sports program. He coordinated activities, coached and also served as an official
for football, basketball, and baseball. He could be found on a field or court at most anytime.
Martin was chairman of the math department at the school where he taught algebra, math analysis, and
computer math. The baseball field at Adams City is named in his honor.
