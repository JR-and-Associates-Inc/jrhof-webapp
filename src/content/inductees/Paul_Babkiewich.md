Paul loved the game of baseball. He played ball at Wheatridge High School where he was a
three-time letterman and team captain. Paul graduated in 1974. He went on to Colorado
State University on a baseball scholarship and graduated in 1978. He was a team captain
during his junior and senior years. Paul would always say he graduated with honors and
achievement, but we all knew better.
Paul was married to Heidi, his college sweetheart, for 35 years. He had 3 children, Brittany,
Brandon, and Tyler. He had 2 grandchildren Sophia and Easton.
After graduation Paul began his career with Gallo Wines. He stayed in that industry for 36
years, the last 20+years with Republic National Distributing where he became a vice
president overseeing sales and operations for their wine and beer divisions in Colorado. He
was highly respected and well known nationally in the industry.
Paul became a High School Baseball official in 1997. He knew the game and worked very
hard to improve and excel as an umpire. His brother Frank always enjoyed the games that
they worked together. They officiated the games at a high level and had great fun doing
them, regardless of the level of play. Paul always felt the players and coaches deserved his
best effort. He had knowledge of the game and how the coaches expected the game to be
played. He was taken from us way too soon.
