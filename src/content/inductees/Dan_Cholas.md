Dan grew up in the small mining and fruit growing town of Paonia. He graduated in 1961 and during his
High School years he achieved All-Conference and All-State honors and was a State Champion in the
discus. A four year, four sport athlete he began his educational career at Mesa Jr. College in Grand
Junction. After two solid years as the Mavericks fullback and kicker, he transferred to the University of
Utah and finished at what is now SCU-Pueblo where he had two outstanding years in football.
Dan graduated from CSU-Pueblo in 1966 and had several try-out offers in football as a place kicker and
running back. He chose the Denver Broncos in 1966 and again in 1968. The dream of becoming a
professional football player finally ended and Dan became a Teacher, Coach and Athletic director for 32
years with 29 of them in the Delta School district. From 1970 to 1973 he was the head football and
baseball coach at Ignacio High School.
Upon his return to Delta, he started out at the freshman level and advanced over the years to becoming
the head football and assistant baseball coach. During his tenure as the Athletic Director at Delta High
School, he was the tournament director for the 1-A Mountain League Baseball and Volleyball
tournaments for 25 years. He was also the Director for several Regional Baseball tournaments.
Dan has umpired for 40 years and attended the Arizona Umpiring Academy for 11 years. He was
honored as a Stagg member and a life time scholarship. Dan umpired in three state championship finals
and several semi and regional games. In 1998 and 1999, Dan umpired in two Babe Ruth World Series,
held in Florida, and was the UIC in 1999. The biggest influence in Dan's teaching and umpiring career
have been his family; his wife Doris, son Peter and daughter Danna. They always gave their support and
views.
