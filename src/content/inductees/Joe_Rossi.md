Joe Rossi's legacy as an umpire spans decades of excellence, leadership, and dedication to the game of baseball across Colorado.

Joe began his umpiring journey in the summer of 1959 and quickly advanced to high school games in 1960 and college games by 1962. Over the years, he officiated in every level of baseball the state had to offer—ranging from high school and American Legion A & B, to Stan Musial League, semi-professional, and collegiate matchups. His expertise and steady presence earned him assignments in state playoffs and championship games across all divisions.

Renowned as one of the best “low zone” umpires in Colorado history, Joe maintained this reputation with consistency and integrity throughout his career.

Beyond the diamond, Joe was instrumental in the development of the Colorado High School Baseball Umpires Association (CHSBUA). In 1963, he served on the founding committee, helping shape the organization’s early mission and standards. Even after retiring from the U.S. Postal Service, Joe remained active in the baseball community. He continues to contribute as the CHSBUA Honorary Chairman and plays a key role in the high school umpire assessment program.

Joe Rossi’s name has become synonymous with the spirit of high school baseball officiating in Colorado—a mentor, pioneer, and the gold standard for generations of umpires to follow.
