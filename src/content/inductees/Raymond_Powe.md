2002 Hall of Fame Inductee Raymond Powe â€“ Colorado Springs
During a 34-year high school officiating career which ran from 1976 to 1999, Ray Powe
made significant contributions to five sports. In addition to our national pastime, Ray
worked football (19 years), basketball (17 years), softball (13 years) and volleyball (five
years).
Ray began umpiring youth baseball as a member of the U.S. Army in Germany in 1966. Over
the following decade he missed two seasons due to two separate Vietnam tours. When he
retired from active duty at Fort Carson in 1976, he brought eight years of experience to high
school baseball.
Ray soon became one of the most steady and respected umpires in the Colorado Springs
association. He worked district playoffs for ten years, regional playoffs for five years. He
earned three invitations to state championship games, last appearing behind the plate for
the 1996 2A finale. He also worked semi-pro games for the Athletes in Action in the 1980's
and for Colorado College until their program met its Title IX demise.
