Ernie attended high school at Merrit Hutton in Thornton, Colorado and graduated in 1967.
He went on to Western state College in Gunnison, Colorado and graduated from there with a

2003. Ernie was the Assignor for the United Pacific and Mile Hi leagues for many years.
Ernie’s first year in Jeffco was with Bill Vencent and Mel Schwartz assigning. The assignor
for Denver was Mr. Wilson and Julie Carrabello was at Metro. The pay was a big seven
dollars and fifty cents for varsity and four dollars for JV. Our uniforms were a white shirt

The next thirty plus years, Ernie enjoyed a good schedule and worked many districts and a
few regional games. He was an assignor for many years as well as the replacement for most
