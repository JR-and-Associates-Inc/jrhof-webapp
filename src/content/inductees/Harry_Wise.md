1992 Hall of Fame Inductee Harry Wise – Englewood
Known for his ability to keep his field in the Denver suburb of Englewood groomed to near-perfection,
Harry Wise was a baseball coaching legend both as a high school and American Legion and Basin League
coach. The field at Englewood High School is appropriately named Harry Wise Field!
Harry Wise Field was the home to the Colorado Baseball Coaches All State Games for many years and
Harry was the only groundskeeper for all those years!
Harry coached for 41 years in Colorado amassing over 500 wins during his tenure at Englewood High
School. His teams were a constant in the league and state playoffs over the years. His 1960 team was a
runner up to eventual champion Denver South. Harry‘s son, Mike pitched and played for him in the
early 1970’s!
Harry also managed the Winner baseball club in the Basin League, which was one of the top college
baseball leagues in the 1960’s and 1970’s. The Basin League was a hotbed for top college players and
future major leaguers. Harry was the closer on those teams which included future major leaguers and
MLB World Series pitchers Jim Lonborg and Jim Palmer.
He played for the 1949 Colorado State College (now UNC) club that made it to the NCAA regional’s. He
pitched and beat Southern California in the second game of the three-game series and started Game 3,
leaving with a 7-0 lead. But the Bears dropped the game 8-7. Nevertheless, Wise was named to the All-
America team for the 1949 season
