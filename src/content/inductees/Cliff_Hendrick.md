1997 Hall of Fame Inductee H. Cliff Hendrick â€“ Denver
H. Clifford Hendrick was one of the first of the new breed of "young lions" to come upon the officiating
scene during the 1970's. The son of the town doctor, and a former standout basketball player at
Roaring Fork High School in Carbondale, Colorado, Cliff joined CHSBUA in 1970 and quickly
distinguished himself as the sport's top "rookie" arbiter.
In 1971 he was selected to his first postseason playoff, beginning an unbroken string of tournament
selections which was to last until his retirement from high school baseball in 1990. But before he
"hung 'em up," Cliff worked the state tournament from 1982-90, including five state championship
games.
Collegiately, Cliff worked in the Big 8 and WAC and was assigned 1986 Western Athletic Conference
Championship Series in San Diego, California. For nine years, beginning in 1983, Cliff was also an
alternate umpire for the American Association (Professional AAA) working with big leaguers like Drew
Coble (American League Crew Chief) among others.
Administratively, Cliff served as supervisor of umpires for The University of Wyoming, assigned the
High School All-Star games for several years, organized the Honorary Group inductions, as well as
serving as Denver area director for the CHSBUA and supervisor of umpires for the Skyline League and
Front Range League. Cliff has been a science teacher in the Cherry Creek schools since 1974.
