Hall of Fame Inductee Dave Letofsky – Aurora, Colorado
An Aurora baseball pioneer along with his twin brother Mert, Dave Letofsky coached from the
pee wee level to American Legion level, winning numerous league, district, regional and state
titles along the way. Dave was instrumental in forming youth leagues throughout Aurora and
organizing programs for youngsters in the Denver area.
Dave coached his three sons — Jeff, Larry and Brian — from the Jaycees level through
American Legion baseball. All three ended up having successful college athletic careers. Dave
also was very instrumental in coaching basketball and football teams throughout Aurora,
although his first love was baseball. “Big Dave” as he was known to all of those who played
for him was a huge influence in the lives of countless young players.

officiating at every level, from state high school championships to NCAA Division I regionals.
Dave was named as an alternate to the College World Staff a number of times. He also was a
high-level softball umpire, working national fastpitch tournaments around the country.
