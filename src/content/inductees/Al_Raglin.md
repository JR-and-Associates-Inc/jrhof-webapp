**2004 Hall of Fame Inductee – Al "Rags" Raglin, Denver**

Al Raglin was a respected and admired figure in Colorado's officiating and community circles. Born in Atlanta, Georgia, he graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in 1950. He went on to study at Metro State College of Denver before beginning a 25-year career in the United States Air Force. Stationed at Lowry Air Force Base and later serving with the 9th Aerospace Wing at the Air Force Academy Financial Center in Colorado Springs, Al retired from military service in 1976.

**A Dedicated Career in Officiating**  
Al began umpiring in the 1960s and continued until his retirement in 1997. He was widely known for officiating A and B playoff games throughout the 60s and 70s and earned assignments in state playoffs across all classifications. He spent years officiating in major collegiate conferences including the Big Eight and the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), and was active in the Northern Colorado Division Playoffs into the mid-1980s.

**A Life of Service Beyond the Diamond**  
Off the field, Al gave back tirelessly to his community. He worked with Denver Public Schools' after-school sports programs, led anger management classes, and volunteered with church groups focused on supporting young children and middle schoolers.
